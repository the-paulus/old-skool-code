# Old Skool Code
This repository contains school work and personal projects in various different languages that I have written over the years. Some of the projects and code file may be incomplete because files got corrupted, I lost interest in the project, or it was a scratch file/project.

## Building and Running
Most of the code was written during the Windows98 era. It's still possible to install Windows98 within a virtual machine along with the required applications.

- [Microsoft MSDN](https://winworldpc.com/product/msdn/vs-60)
- [Microsoft Office 97](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-office/97-98) - Serial is included in the archive.
- [Microsoft Visual J++ 6.0](https://winworldpc.com/product/visual-j/60) - No serial required.
- [Microsoft Visual Studio 6 Enterprise](https://winworldpc.com/product/microsoft-visual-stu/60) - The archive contains three ISO files, the first being the setup CD. A product key shouldn't be required.
- [Microsoft Windows98SE](https://winworldpc.com/product/windows-98/98-second-edition) - Several different downloads of Windows98 are listed on this page. If you have VMWare, you can import the downloaded VM and start installing the above applications. When using VirtualBox, download the **OEM FULL** as it's bootable. Serials are found on the page.
